# Where is PenguinMod Desktop?

If you came to this repository expecting PenguinMod desktop and a download link, sorry! :(

We have not made a desktop app yet. This repository was just a fork of TurboWarp's desktop app that has NOT been edited to work with PenguinMod.

Please be patient with us. We'll provide links to our real desktop project here once possible.
